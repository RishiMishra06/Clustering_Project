# Online Retail Customer Segmentation using Clustering:-
This project implements customer segmentation using unsupervised learning (clustering) techniques on the Online Retail dataset. The aim is to identify distinct groups of customers based on their purchasing behavior to help the business target them more effectively.

# Technologies Used:-

- Python

- Pandas, NumPy

- Scikit-learn

- Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Plotly (for interactive visualization)

- Jupyter Notebook

# Project Workflow:-

1.Data Cleaning:- 

- Remove null entries

- Remove negative quantity or price

- Handle duplicates

2.Feature Engineering:- 

- RFM feature creation

- Standardization and normalization

3.Clustering Techniques:-

- Elbow method to find optimal clusters

- K-Means Clustering

- Hierarchical Clustering

4.Visualization:-

- 2D and 3D cluster plots

- RFM distribution plots

- Dendrogram for hierarchical clustering
